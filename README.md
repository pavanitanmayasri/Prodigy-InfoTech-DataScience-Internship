Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at `Prodigy Infotech`. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

## Dataset

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a population dataset and created visualizations to understand the distribution of population data across years.

📁 Dataset

The dataset used for this task is World Population Dataset, sourced from the World Bank.

Indicator: Total Population

Years Covered: 2001 – 2022

Dataset Link:

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

Jupyter Notebook – For data analysis and visualization

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Statistical data visualization

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, the following steps were performed:

1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately

Verified dataset structure and column consistency

Removed unnecessary metadata rows

2️⃣ Data Visualization

Created bar charts to visualize population distribution

Created stacked charts to compare population trends across years

Analyzed trends and variations in population growth

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
